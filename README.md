## Jared Hector's First Portfolio Site

With this website, I wanted to capture the feeling of incoming fall. In effort to align with demo guidelines, there is a header with navigation functionality to the three main sections of the page: "About", "Works", and "Contact".

The "About" section contains a small paragraph describing me and my background while the "Works" section contains (currently dead) links to portfolio projects. The images are laid out in a flexbox and grid fashion so they scale with the page. The "Contact" section has clickable links to my email and GitHub accounts as well as my phone number.

If the viewport is scaled down enough, the layout of the page updates to be more mobile-friendly and many of the flexboxes change to column direction to accomodate.
